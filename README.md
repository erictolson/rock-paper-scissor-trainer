# rock-paper-scissors-trainer
This SwiftUI project is a result of the first 'milestone' in "Hacking With Swift's 100 Days of SwiftUI".

In this simple rock, paper, scissor game app, the user is shown a computer's choice of either rock, paper, or scissor. They are then told to choose either the winning or losing move to the computer's choice.

This project follows the guidelines <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/2/3/challenge" target="_blank">here</a>
, from Paul Hudson's "100 Days of Swift UI" tutorial program.

Please see the below video of the app run on an iPhone 14 Pro simulator.
